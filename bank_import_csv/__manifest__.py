    we are going to import the statement as  account.payments  and not as account.bank.statement.line
    the complexity of workig is 10 times bigger in having 2 models for payments instead of one with 2 more fields
    
    no more invoice in_payment, no more 2 recociliation, no more same info in pyament and bank account.bank.statement.line
    no more hiden menus for statements ..

    2. also to reconcile the payments with invoices
    3. in payment list also to review = that that have as client not found clinet
