    If the partner has Credit Limit at partner in Sale&Purcase Tab, can show payment_on_credit  option as payment method on site,
    For partners that do not have credit_limit is not showing this type of payment.
    If is over the limit will show a warning and the payment method can not be used (is disabled) .
    It knows when is over the limit from trying to set a sale_order to sent and if raise error will show that error ( form partner_current_debit_credit_payments)
     
    
    When this payment method is selected, the order will be validated automatically ( like at a online payment)
